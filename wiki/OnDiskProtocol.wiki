#summary Meaning of files in data directory

= Introduction =

All communication into and out of [DefinitionModule Definitions] and
[DynamicModule Dynamics] is through the files under
{{{data/worlds/$world/state}}} and the output of the hooks provided by
the Definition and Dynamic modules.

The documentation for the hooks can be found under HookProtocol.

All paths in this document are relative to a world's base directory.

= Write Access =

The scripts under bin/ are the only writers.  This is not currently
enforced, but a mature implementation would probably do so both for
performance and management reasons.

= Canonical State =

The {{{state}}} directory contains state which has been provided or
vetted by Definitions.  In the Setup and Finalization 
[StatePhases phases] the {{{bin/run}}} script invokes the Definition
hooks, gathers their output (currently in YAML format) and commits it
to the current state directory.  If any Definitions attempt to
overwrite existing state it is an error and the run script should bail
out with a helpful error message.

== Discrete State Directories ==

World states are numbered with integers starting at 0.

State 0 is a special state which has had no input from Dynamics and
which is a good place to keep "constants" which describe the
relationships of the Definitions and Dynamics.  For example, in a
Prisoner's Dilemma game the definitions might provide names for the
"players" and those names would not be expected to change throught the
game.  Those names would be stored in state 0.

States 1 and up are generated by the StatePhases.  

== Current State ==

= Dynamic-Requested State =

During the Activity phase the run script calls the {{{query}}},
gathers their output and commits it to the {{{log}}} directory.  This
output cannot have conflicts because each Dynamic's output is placed
in a separate directory.  The Definitions are tasked with converting
this output into canonical state in the Finalization phase.

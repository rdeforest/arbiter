#summary Structure of Definitions

Definitions are the constraints within which [DynamicModule Dynamics]
operate.  Definitions are concerned with the nature of the experiment
being performed while Dynamics represent the "variables" to be
compared in the experiment.

= Files =

The source for Definition modules is kept in {{{data/definitions}}} in
directories named after the Definitions.  Each world keeps its own
list of imported Definitions as a set of symlinks under its own
{{{definitions}}} directory.  The links are named with a leading
number used to represent the order of the definitions.

= Hooks =

All hooks are invoked with the current working directory set to the
root of the world directory.

== called by {{{bin/add}}} ==

=== add-to-world ===

Invoked when the current definition is to be added to a world.

=== add-definition name ===

Invoked to see if this Definition approves of the addition of another
Definition after it.  Takes the name of the added Definition as a
parameter.

=== add-dynamic ===

Invoked to see if this Definition approves of the addition of a
Dynamic.

== start-iteration ==

Invoked in the [StatePhases Setup phase].  Output is written directly
to the new state.

== end-iteration ==

Invoked in the [StatePhases Finalization phase].  Output is written
directly to the new state.  Definition will likely consult the log and
current state to determine its output.

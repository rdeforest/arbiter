It should not take more than a few minutes to create a simple Constraint or Generator.  For example, to create a "Cooperate until my opponent defects, then always defect", the query script should just be a few lines:

  * is opponent's previous move defect?
    * set strategy to defect (echo "strategy: defect")
    * set play to defect (echo "play: defect")
    * exit
  * is current strategy is defect?
    * set strategy to defect
    * play defect
    * exit
  * play cooperate

Prisoner's Dilemma - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma

Dynamics are strategies.  Only two strategies are run at a time in this
version.  Strategies are named 'alice' and 'betty'.  The definition refers to
itself as 'trent'.

The only output of dynamics should be "play: cooperate" or "play: defect".
